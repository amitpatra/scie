## Context

For current, we had some different choise:

 - lex-based analyser
 - grammer-based analyser

for  `Package`, `DataStruct`, `Method`, `Fields` identify, use text-editor grammer will be more easy.

So we have some different choise too:

 - Sublime Text syntax definitions, such as [https://github.com/trishume/syntect](https://github.com/trishume/syntect)
 - TextMate grammars, as [https://macromates.com/manual/en/language_grammars](https://macromates.com/manual/en/language_grammars) use in VS Code: [Syntax Highlight Guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/syntax-highlight-guide)

 in currently, let's try VS Code logic. It's open source and more popular.
